# Atomix - Trial for Frontend Developers
### Focusing on: HTML, CSS and responsive skills

## Introduction
Hello everyone üëãüèº, firstly I would like to congratulate on being selected for a trial for our full-stack web developer role advertised on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3160453756/), and we so excited to know you better and also to find out your skills even more.

In regard to how we have structured the trial will be in two parts. This trial will test your frontend skills (HTML, CSS and responsive skills). 

#### Step 2 (NOT IN THIS REPOSITORY) - Choose either [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), or [WordPress](https://en-au.wordpress.org/download/) to complete a working website using this frontend work

## How to setup the project
This repo is setup using [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) and its really easy to setup locally. 

You will need atleast [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16+ to start with. Thereafter, simply run `yarn install` to install the packages and `yarn start` to run and start working on the site locally.

## Design
Here is the [creative XD designs](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9b96df8b-7468-4806-9b66-1a0cd6e30fa4-cec5/) you need to start work on. By clicking on the `</>` icon on the right top corner, you will be able to access the assets and information for the creative layouts.

The design consists of a few important sections:
1. Header with a menu (global sections)
2. Home banner
3. 3 column content section
4. Carousel with a slider. We recommend using [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/), but you can use any JavaScript slider carousel here which you are familiar with
5. Team grid layout
6. Footer with menu links (global sections)

** Note: The layout also contain a mobile design to guide you with your responsive development 

### 1. Header
The header contains several parts, and they need to be implemented accordingly. It contains a logo, menu and a call to action button. The menu contains a mega menu with additional links and all the header components need to support the mobile menu layouts as well.

### 6. Footer
The footer contains the footer menu, with a copyright text and social icons with links. The footer links need to support mobile designs and need to change to an accordion on smaller screens.

### Additional information
You can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the layout (we have already added it for you) and can also use any components from it, if needed.

## How to submit your work?
